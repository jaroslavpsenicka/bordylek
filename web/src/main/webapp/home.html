                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency">time-based currency</a> is an alternative
                    currency where the unit of account/value is the person-hour or some other time unit.
                    Contributions are equal: one hour equals one hour. No exchange rates. Simple.</p>

                <p>Enough virtual friends and imaginary companions. This is real, as real as people from your district
                    can be. Help someone with his garden. Accept someone else's lift from the pub. All free of charge.
                    Only time counts.</p>

                <p>Community does not necessarily mean to have your house full of drunk people every Friday. Just stay
                    in touch with your neighborhoods and be ready to give and accept help. That's more than enough.</p>
